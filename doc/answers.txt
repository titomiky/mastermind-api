• What is your favorite package manager and why?
I don't have any favorite package manager, I usually use the most used according to the programming language and frameworks.

• What architecture did you follow for this project?
Microservice with repository access.


• Do you know and understand UML? What would the class diagram of the domain exposed in the mastermind game be like for you?
It's a very simple exercise to use UML. I prefer to document using openAPI/swagger because documentation trends to be discontinued.

ESLint, prettier, husky...
